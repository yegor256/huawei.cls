\maketitle

In this document you don't see the logo, because we use \ff{nobrand}
option of the class:

\begin{minted}{text}
\documentclass[nobrand]{huawei}
\begin{document}
The rest of the document...
\end{document}
\end{minted}

By the way, we use \TeX{} created by~\citet{knuth1984texbook}
and \LaTeX{} created by~\citet{lamport1994latex}. The citations
provided at the bottom of the document are printed via
\ff{\textbackslash{}PrintBibliography}.

The text in small font at the bottom of the page is printed by
the \ff{\textbackslash{}PrintDisclaimer} command.
